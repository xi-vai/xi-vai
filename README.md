- i’m darxival
- i'm interested in computers and coding
- i’m currently learning nothing

- pronouns: prefer they/them, also he/him
- fun fact: my name is rare enough for me to be @darxival on most platforms

alr time for non-default stuff.
i'm teaching myself css so i can mod discord,
my small projects will be put here.
i may also make other things during the next school year;
i should be learning cs195 and the CompTIA Net+ course.*
